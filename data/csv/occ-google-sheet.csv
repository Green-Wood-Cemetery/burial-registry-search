""John Ansley was the first local Postmaster in the Mineral Point area. [not sure if  this is correct - check History of Iowa CO - nsp]
John D. Ansley was the son of Thomas and Mary (Scott) Ansley. He was born in Canada.
Ansley is said to have been married but left no family. He is mentioned in his father's letters as of a roving disposition and as spending part of his life at sea. In 1829 [check this - very early nsp] he went to Mineral Point, Wisconsin and became a prominent man in the territory of Wisconsin, being known as Col. Ansley. The last record of his activities is of a trip to England to finance his mining operations. Source: ""Our Ansley Family"" by Harold Ansley Davidson, 1933, p. 16.

From WI Dictionary of History re: John D. Ansley
In 1829 he was a resident of Mineral Point where he owned a dry-goods store and a copper mine three miles to the south. In 1835 and 1836 he was smelting ore that assayed as much as 20 to 30 per cent copper and was bringing high prices in Boston. Encouraged by his prospects, he obtained capital investors in Pennsylvania. Adverse reports by George W. Featherstonhaugh, however, resulted in his backers having him jailed for fraud. He next sought capital in England but again Featherstonhaugh's reports prevented consummation of his plans. His mine was incorporated in the Iowa Copper Company in 1844. J. Schafer, Wis.

    Such, Messrs. Editors, is the brief announcement of an event by which one of the oldest and most respected citizens of this place has passed from among us.
    Curtis Beech was born in Pitcher, Chenango county, N.Y. March 21st, 1805. He resided mostly in his native town till at the age of 30 he came to make his home in the Territory of Wisconsin, where he lived till his death.
     In the earlier history of this place he was a leading business man, and, as the writer has heard him say, knew by name almost every resident for 20 miles around. as a man and a neighbor he was universally esteemed. With strict integrity and a kind heart, he combined to a rare degree, a mirthfulness and humor which made him to the very last, an agreeable companion, even to the youth.
    But is was as a Christian that he left the deepest impression here. hopefully converted at the age of 22, he became from the first an active christian, laboring with great zeal and fidelity in the prayer-meeting and sunday school; and these labors distinguished him to the end of his life. He organized the first sunday school that was held in Mineral Point and that before a church edifice was built here. the date of that beginning was, it is believed, 1837. From that time to his final prostration by his last sickness, he held the position of Superintendent of the sunday school, and discharged its duties with a promptness and fidelity rarely equaled in any place. Though the school was divided and part went to form the nucleus of what is now the large and prosperous school of the M.E. Church, yet may we safely say that the original school remained under his care so long as he lived; thus presenting, as we think, not only the oldest sunday school now in the State, but the rare spectacle of a sunday school presided over by the same man for 29 years.
     At the organization of the Presbyterian Church, June 30, 1839, the name of Curtis Beech stands first on the list of proposed members; and after its organization he was the first man elected as Ruling Elder, though but a young man of 34 years. Hence, as a Church, we lose in him our first member, our first Ruling Elder, and the first and only Superintendent of our Sunday school.
    In all his duties as a christian he showed the same faithfulness and regularity that so endeared him to the children. Rarely absent from any service, whether on the Sabbath or devotional gatherings on other days, he has left an example most worthy of imitation. Truly ""the memory of the just be blessed.""
     ""Rest from thy labors, rest,
      Soul of the just set free;
      Blest be thy mem'ry, and blessed
      Thy bright example be.""

Last Thursday the angel of death came and bore away from our midst the beloved wife of Mr. Wm. Chesterfield, of this city, thus leaving a vacant chair that can never be filled. Aged 82 years. The deceased had been in failing health for over a year, and although it was seen that she wasn't long for this world, the family did not think that the end was so near. She, with her husband, was among the first early settlers in this section. Besides the husband several grown up children are left to mourn the loss of a kind and loving wife and mother. The funeral was held last Sunday afternoon with services at the P.M. church; Rev. Kent officiating.

He had been sick but a few hours, and the community was wholly unprepared for the sad announcement. On the day previous he was out with his family, gathering hazelnuts and enjoying a day of rest from his business. He returned in the evening apparently in usual health, but within an hour was stricken with paralysis and was not conscious afterward.
    Deceased was a native of Durham county, England, born May 17, 1825. In 1864 he came to Mineral Point, and has resided here constantly ever since, doing business as a blacksmith. Before emigrating he was married to Miss Rachel Wallace, who died here in 1871. Four daughters survive, namely, Mrs. Maggie Pratt, Mrs Jennie Noble, Mrs Nellie Fowler, and Miss Rachel Day. In his long residence here he had won general esteem, as an honorable, industrious citizen, a genial, kind neighbor, and a devoted husband and father. His funeral, which took place on Friday, with services at Trinity Episcopal church was attended by a large number of sorrowing friends.
The following transcribed from a newspaper clipping on the back of a photo of George Day; probably from the Iowa County Democrat Sept. 12, 1895:  George Day
Died at his home in the city of Mineral Point, on Wednesday afternoon at 5 o’clock, Mr. George Day; aged 70 years, 3 months and 23 days.
	The deceased was in good health up to Tuesday night. He had been hazel-nutting that day with the family and came home in good spirits, but shortly after his arrival home suffered a stroke of paralysis and never again became fully conscious. Mr. Day was born in county Durham, England, May 17, 1825; was married to Miss Rachael Wallace in England; came to America in 1854, and began business in Mineral Point as a blacksmith. He constantly resided here. He was a good citizen and a kind husband and father. His wife died 24 years ago. They had nine daughters; four of whom are now living, namely, Mrs. Maggie Pratt, Mrs. Jennie Noble, Mrs. Nellie Fowler, Miss Rachael Day.
	The funeral will take place tomorrow, Friday, afternoon with services at Trinity Episcopal Church.

WILLIAM T. Henry, lawyer and banker, Mineral Point; was born in St. Louis, Mo., May 9, 1823; he came to Galena, Ill., with his parents, in 1824, arriving there in May of that year; remained in Galena until the spring of 1833, when, with his parents, he took up his abode with Capt. De Seelhorst, of Elk Grove, now in La Fayette County; in October of 1833, he removed to Dodgeville, where his father engaged in merchandising and was also appointed the first Postmaster; in October, 1834, his father located in Mineral Point, where William T. has since resided, with the exception of a brief period spent in the gold mines of California. He attended the common schools of his locality until 1837 and 1838, when he went to Springfield and took a two-years course in the high school of that city; returning home in 1839, he entered the store of Curtis Beech, one of the pioneer merchants of the city, serving in the capacity of clerk; was subsequently appointed Deputy Clerk of the United States Court, and served under Dr. Edward McSherry, George W. Jones and Henry L. Dodge, and, in May, 1846, Mr. Henry was appointed by Judge Dunn Clerk of the United States Court, which office he held until Jan, 1, 1849; in the interregnum between his appointments to office, Mr. Henry was engaged in mining. He was married, Aug. 2, 1848, to Miss Nellie, daughter of Gen. William R. and Mary Smith at Mineral Point; had one child—William Francis, who died June 15,1850, aged 1 year. Oct 8,1849, Mr. Henry started for California, via Panama, and returned to Mineral Point, via Nicaragua, Oct. 12,1851; he again left for California Nov. 11, 1851, accompanied by his wife, who was then suffering with consumption. Mrs. Henry did not live to return, having died in Sacramento City Dec. 17, 1852. William T. returned to Mineral Point May 6, 1855, and was appointed Secretary of the Mineral Point Railroad Company, and continued in this capacity until the road was successfully completed to this point. While acting as Secretary of the Mineral Point Railroad Company, he commenced an abstract of the county and established his law business, and, in the fall of 1861 adding thereto the banking business, all of which he still continues; aside from this, Mr. Henry is extensively engaged in mining, and, with his partner, John J. Ross, owns perhaps the most valuable mineral range in Southwestern Wisconsin. He married Mrs. Emma Parmele, daughter of Rev. Stephen McHugh, Sept. 18,1856; she had two sons by her former marriage— Thomas and Charles Parmele. now in Mr. Henry's bank. By this union Mr. Henry had five children, all of whom are living—Nettie E., William T., Cora M., Emma N., Francis G. Emma N. is attending school at Kenosha and William T., Jr., at Racine. Mr. Henry has always been a Democrat; has been frequently elected Mayor of the city, although he is not a politician nor office-seeker, and has always possessed, in a marked degree, the confidence of the business men in the community, no matter which political party they belonged to. He is remarkably energetic and industrious, liberal and charitable, and, amidst his great and varied business cares, he has found time to become a learned and accomplished mineralogist. His cabinet of minerals is one of the largest and best selected in the United States, and no man in the State is so thoroughly acquainted with the geology of the lead region.","William Turner Henry

Lanyon, Sr., calmly went to her eternal reward on Wednesday, August 17, 1898. She was born in June, 1815, at St Arme, England, her girlhood name being Mary Ann Bennetts. April 21, 1833, she became the wife of William Lanyon, and continued such until her death, the couple celebrating the 65th anniversary of their wedding last April. In 1840 she came with her husband to Wisconsin, and resided her continuously thereafter.  Fourteen sons and one daughter were born to the sturdy couple. The daughter died when four years old, at Linden, where the family temporarily resided on coming to the territory. The two first born sons died in England. One died of gas suffocation when five years old, while playing about his father's furnace in this city. One other son died in early childhood, and the youngest, when a lad of about eight years, was accidentally drowned by falling into a cistern, several years ago. Nine stalwart sons survive to cherish the memory of a devoted mother and to comfort their honored father. They are: William, Cyrus, Josiah John, Simon, Albert, Samuel, Robert, and Edwin. Mrs. Lanyon was a worthy type of pioneer wife. With her own hands she did the household work incident to caring for her large family through their childhood. n those days before sewing machines or steam laundries, her expert needle and industrious hands kept her many boys comfortably clothed, clean and well fed. Even in later years her needlework had been a wonder and admiration to the younger generation. She was one of the heroines of everyday life, the glory of whose conquests is seen in results that come after they have laid their armor by.

In 1849, he established his foundry and machine-shops, and carried on the business until 1875, when he gave up the active management of the business to his sons. Mr. Lanyon has lived here over forty years, and for thirty-five years has been successfully engaged in business life. He has held the offices of City Alderman and City Assessor. When he began life he had nothing, and his success is owing to his own efforts and industry. Mr. Lanyon was united in marriage, April 21, 1833, to Miss Mary Ann Bennett, a native of Cornwall, England; they have had fourteen children, nine of whom survive - William, Cyrus, Josiah, John, Simon S., Albert, Samuel, Robert H. and Edwin V.

For half a century the name of William Lanyon has been familiar to the readers of the Tribune. Few names have appeared in these columns oftener, and now with deep regret we reprint the name to record that he who bore it is but a memory. Saturday morning Feb. 11th, the spirit of William Lanyon took its flight for the undiscovered country, and Tuesday morning his mortal remains were laid beside those of his life companion, in the old Mineral Point cemetery.
	Mr. Lanyon was born Nov. 8, 1810, and consequently had lived almost 89 years. His birthplace was Elston, England. There he grew to manhood, one of a family of nine sturdy brothers and sisters. He learned the trade of blacksmith and machinist, and prosecuted the business throughout the years of his active life. In 1833 he married the wife whose death was recorded only last August. In 1840 they came to America, and located in Wisconsin, which was ever after their home.
	Soon after arriving here Mr. Lanyon was recognized as a forceful factor in the development of the town. Never content with what was, when he thought it could be enlarged or bettered. He took hold of any proper enterprise readily furnishing employment for men when they otherwise might have been idle, and making improvements that might not have been but for him. Such a man could but stimulate enterprise in others, accomplish much for the general good, and leave an impress upon the community in which he operated. No history of the progress of Mineral Point can be completed without the name of William Lanyon frequently therein. In business he was honorable as he was energetic, in social intercourse kind and considerate, to his adopted country thoroughly loyal and to his family strongly devoted.
	Until the death of his wife he was a wonder of physical activity for so old a man. Since she was taken from him he has failed rapidly, but bore up manfully till the last, when he quietly surrendered, full of christian hope that there awaited him the rewards of a well spent, useful life.
	The funeral Tuesday morning with services by Rev Thos. Kent, was attended by his brothers Robert and Samuel, his sons Cyrus, Josiah, John, Simon, Albert, and Edwin, besides a large number of other relatives, long time neighbors and friends, many of whom came great distances to pay last respects to the honored dead. Three sons were unable to attend, viz: William, Samuel and Robert.

Herbert Luke, aged about 11 years, son of Mrs Carrie Luke, an esteemed widow resident of this city, was killed in the elevator, ast the Mineral Point Woolen Mills Thursday afternoon, the 5th inst. The boy had carried dinner to Mr. Sherman, engineer at the mill, who is a boarder of Mrs. Luke. After eating his dinner, Mr. Sherman told the boy he had better return home, not wanting him to remain about the mill, and he went out of the building through the engine room door. But he must have reentered by some other way, as he was seen in and about other parts of the building during the afternoon. Discovery of the accident, about 5 o’clock, came through the slipping of a belt and the interruption of operating machinery, which led one of the employes (sic) on the third floor to open the door of the elevator shaft. There the boy was found, held between the elevator platform and the top of the door casing in the shaft. He was taken out at once. His pulses were felt to throb a few times and then ceased forever. Death must have been almost instantaneous, as the interruption of operating machinery occasioned by the clogging of the elevator was but a moment before the shaft door was opened.
	The theory of the mill men is that the boy must have got into the elevator on one of the lower floors and pulled the rope that operated it. That finding himself being carried to the top of the shaft he attempted to open the door at the third floor and failing was caught between the moving elevator platform and the door sill, as described. Some of his ribs were broken and the body flattened considerably but there was no mutilation.
	The accident is a terrible blow to the widowed mother with whom every parent heart beats in pained sympathy.
	The family gratefully acknowledge the kindness of many friends in this great sorrow. Mineral Point Tribune March 3, 1896",1896,MPLA db: b.d. 1885@; d.o.d. 3/5/1896; changed 10/2/15 nsp,,"1966-68

A large crowd of people, nearly sufficient to fill the P.M. church, attended the funeral of Mr. William Luke, who so suddenly was removed from our midst. He was dead before hardly anyone knew he was sick, attacked with congestion of the lungs on Wednesday, and silent in death at 7:00 clock on the morning of Saturday. People from surrounding places were not a few in number who were anxious to testify as best they may to the affection held for the departed and his family. And certainly, if the sympathy of this city for the family - as well as the feelings of respect for the deceased - be in proportion to the number of citizens who were in attendance at the ceremonies, then most assuredly can the family take all the consolation coming from such a circumstance. And such a feeling of respect and sympathy we know there was and now is.  Mr. Luke was born in Cornwall, Eng. on the 28th of Dec. 1842; was a member of the P.M. church in this city; leaves a wife and three children to feel the bereavement of a true husband and father.

Newlyweds Hugh and Margaret McNeill immigrated to America from County Antrim, Ireland, in the 1840s, after being disowned by both of their families. Hugh was Irish protestant, Jane Scotch Catholic; their union was deeply disapproved of by their parents.
“They were banished. It was as if they had died,” says their great-grandson, Bob McNeill, who grew up in Iowa County.
Hugh and Margaret bought a farm near Hollandale in 1848. In the town of Waldwick, on a road that still bears their name – McNeill Road – they built a rock farmhouse that remains standing today. Descendants went on to farm there for generations. The house, sold about ten years ago by the McNeill family, is now privately owned.","Hugh McNeill 1812 - 1860

Mr. John Pearce, who died last Friday evening, May 28, was one of our oldest and most esteemed citizens. He was born at Camborne, Cornwall England, July 22, 1816, and was at the time of his death nearly 81 years of age. His early life was shadowed by the death of his mother, and he was the ninth in his family of ten children and was the only one left to cross the river. His early life was the usual one of toil to those born in his station, and at the age of nine years he became a toiler in the mine. Having, when of suitable age, married Miss Mary Nichols, he, with other members of the family, came to Wisconsin in 1842 and in Iowa county he made his home ever after, except for the few years he spent in digging gold in California. In 1848 he buried his wife and in due time was married to Miss Joanna Baker, of Linden, who lived until 1871. In 1873 he was married to Mrs. Kislingbury, who after a union of twenty-four years survives him. He was an industrious and upright man, an intelligent citizen and an ardent republican. But his chief delight was in his church and Bible. . . .  The funeral last Sunday afternoon was very largely attended, the entire Sunday school forming a long procession and escorting the remains from the home to the church. He sleeps in the old grave yard - at last free from suffering and at rest. Mineral Point Tribune June 3, 1897",1897,dates per MPLA obit db which lists Cornwall as birthplace,NE.32.1,"1978

Obituary for Jane Selina Holmes Poquette Matthews, 
Iowa County Democrat, November 13, 1902:
	“Mrs. JANE MATTHEWS, wife of Jonathan Matthews, died at her home in this city, Sunday night, Nov. 9, 1902 at about 9:30 o’clock. Deceased was born in Staffordville [Staffordshire], England, April 27, 1830, and at the same year 
came with her parents to America, settling in Pennsylvania; five years later she moved with her parents to Wisconsin.”

“In 1844 she was married to LOUIS POQUETTE; thirteen children were born to them. Four sons and two daughters survive the mother, all of whom were present at the funeral, namely; John H, Beloit; Louis and Leonard of Waldwick; George of this city; Mrs. Josephine Davis, of Willow Springs; Mrs. Sophia Powell of Shullsburg. In 1898 she was united in marriage to Mr. Jonathan Matthews, who is 
left to mourn the loss of a devoted Christian wife.”
“The funeral took place on Tuesday morning, with services at Trinity Episcopal Church, Rev. Mr. Chase officiating; and burial in Graceland Cemetery*. The large attendance of neighbors and friends attested to the high esteem in which 
the deceased was held by the community.”
Additional Comments:
[*Iowa County record of death states that she was buried in City Cemetery, Mineral Point, WI, as do Rev. Chase’s church notes. There we find a headstone for LOUIS POQUETTE and his children, but JANE’s name is not carved on the stone. The Matthews family had a family plot on the ‘Wallace farm.’ Could JANE have been buried there, since the newspaper and the Death Record do not agree?]

The young  lady was put in a very open room, where the wind and snow had free access, and fed on brandy and pepper for inflammation in the bowels. No physician was called until death had done its work, although the deceased requested one several days previous.

 Nicholas Temby was born in the parish of Camborne, Cornwall, England, in the year 1818, and was consequently at the time of his death 68 years and about 6 months old. Hearing much said about the chances for working men in America, he, in company with his late wife, left the old home and arrived at Mineral Point in 1847. Excepting brief stays in Dodgeville and parts of California, this city has ever since been his home. For many years he lived without God and hope, but during the winter of '70 and '71 he was led to see the follies of sin and became a lover and follower after righteousness. His religious character has been of the emotional type. He cultivated high degrees of feeling and always enjoyed best the means of grace that were characterized by this same feature. He has been a faithful member of the P.M. society, being a pattern to others in his attendance on the services of God's house - both social and public. His prayer in the P.M. vestry on last Monday week was so full of unction that it elicited favorable comment. For the last five or six years he has been a failing man, having in that time passed through seasons of severe afflictions. He has for a long time been simply waiting to be relieved from the infirmities of the flesh. Relief came on Friday afternoon. While in the act of carrying an armful of wood into his home he strained himself, producing the cough which burst the vein that gave escape to life's fluid. He died on the porch of his house.

In Memoriam. 
Mr. Bennett
Mrs Ann Terrill, born Oct. 21st, A.D. 1874 [sic], in Cornwall, England. She was married in 1836, and became the mother of ten children, five of whom preceded her to ""the better land."" For thirty-seven years she walked by the side of her now deeply bereaved husband; and bore, as he testifies, all the trials of life with great patience; and a kind heart, ever ready to sympathize with others. In 1849 she embraced the religion of Christ, and in all the after years exemplified it truth. In 1850 she left England with her mother, and four children, and joined her husband at Mineral Point. She was a most faithful wife, and as devoted a mother as children were ever blessed with. Her memory will always be enshrine in the hearts of her friends, as sweet incense. They live in the blest hope of a happy re-union. She fell asleep in Christ April 11th, 1874.

The circumstances appear to be about as follows: Between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, Mrs. Terrill left her home to visit the lately bereaved Mrs. Strachan. About 10 P.M. she started on her return home in usual health. A few minutes later, some men passing on the sidewalk near Trinity Church found her a corpse. For years Mrs. Terrill had been afflicted with heart disease, and was subject to sudden prostrating spasms; it is supposed that walking against the strong cold wind, produced one of these attacks, resulting in almost instant death.
   Mrs Terrill was one of the oldest residents of Mineral Point, and few enjoyed so large an acquaintance and so general esteem. Wherever was sickness or bereavement, she was oftener found, perhaps, than any other lady of our city, giving help and consolation. Many whose pillows of pain have been smoothed by her ministering hands, and many whose desolate hearts have been cheered by her presence, will cherish her memory and now join in deepest sympathy with her bereaved family in mourning her sad passage to the other shore. She was 57 years of age. The funeral on Tuesday was one of the largest ever known in the city.

Dr. Van Dusen came to Mineral Point is 1848, from Tully, New York, and for over 35 years attended to the duties of his profession in this city and vicinity. He was an able practitioner, and faithful to his patients, and lost none of his keenness of medical intuition, with advancing years, until the terrible paralysis, from which he has been so great a sufferer, made its power manifest, during the last two months. The Doctor did not die RICH - not because he had not had practice enough, nor because he was a spendthrift, but because the average moral sense of so many people does not reach to the doctor's bill; it, like the printer's, can go over. He was one of the organizers of the State Medical Association, and was greatly honored by the leading men of his profession throughout the state. At home he took much interest in educational matters, and was for many years president of the board of education. He was also an enthusiastic Free Mason.

Wisconsin United States,,,03,,1884,,Francis,Vivian,,,20,03,MP Tribune,"Death of ""Uncle Frank"" Vivian
Last Friday, at his farm residence near Dodgeville, Mr. Francis Vivian's spirit was harvested by the angel of death, at the ripe old age of 83. His taking off was caused by inflammation of the lungs, from which he had suffered several days in a hopeless condition. He was one of the first and most constant settlers in Iowa county, coming here in 1832, and, with the exception of but a few months, has been here ever since. His good qualities were many and hid in oblivion what trifling errors he might have possessed. Considerate, kind-hearted and generous from youth to age - qualities that insured him respect all through life, and will glisten in the halls of memory long after his death.
   Following is a sketch of his career in life from the time he left his place of nativity up to his demise, as taken mainly from the recently compiled history of Iowa county:
   Francis Vivian, the veteran ex-county treasurer of Iowa county, was born Feb. 19, 1801, in Camborn, Cornwall, England: his early life was spent in the tin and copper mines of Cornwall.  The year 1832 found him in Mineral Point, and the day after his arrival here he enlisted in Capt. John Moore's company to war against Black Hawk, and remained at the garrison in this place until the red chief was overthrown. Mr. V. then mined lead a year on the Van Matre survey; spent a few months in Dubuque, and then locating in Mineral Point, resided here for twenty-five years. For a few years he kept store; was then for a few years a partner of Jenkings & Musgrove, in the smelting business; he was next employed by a Buffalo, N.Y., firm as agent in buying mineral. He was one of the first men to be elected President of the village of Mineral Point. In '56 he was elected county treasurer, which position he held for sixteen years, probably a greater length of time than any man in the northwest in the same office. In 1865 he settled in Dodgeville, and from there removed to his farm in '74; 80 acres of this farm he secured from the government in early day. He married in 1827, Dinah Kendall, of Cornwall; she died in '59, leaving three children - Mrs. Jas. Toay and Mrs. Cyrus Lanyon, of this city, and William F., a farmer. In '60 he married again, to Miss Jane Hollow; they had five children, all but one survive him. ""Uncle Frank"", as he was best known, was a good type of the men who hewed down the barriers, that settlement and civilization might follow them into the State and county.
     The remains on being brought to this city on Sunday for interment by the side of his first wife, were rested in the P.M. church, toward which he liberally contributed in its infancy, and a short, appropriate funeral service held, Rev. P. Allen officiating. The attendance was exceptionally large in view of the bad roads and inclement weather.
    This is the fourth death in this family close to within a year. In Feb., 1883, his daughter Ida, was summoned to the beyond, then only a few weeks ago his second wife, followed by that of our esteemed Citizen, Jas. Toay, son-in-law of ""Uncle Frank"". Surely affliction falls with terrible force in places; and, although sympathy soothes and heals sorrow in only a small degree, it has been plainly visible on every hand.

The deceased was born in county Monaghan, Ireland; came to America at an early age, with her father, Samuel Gibson, and her sister, Mrs. Garland, both long since deceased.

Mr. and Mrs. Walker opened their hotel, ""The Mineral Point House"" in 1861. Deceased was a woman of great kindness of heart, a true wife, whose constant aim appeared to be to bring sunshine and happiness to the lives of others. Her aged husband survives her, also her niece, Mss Erskine, who has been with her constantly during her illness. Though for many years she remained closely at home, this fact did not lessen the number of her friends who know and appreciated her true worth, and loved her for her gentle, self sacrificing spirit. Her life was full of good deeds done in a quiet way. For nine years she has been an invalid from paralysis, and during the last year and a half of her life her sufferings were great in the extreme so that death was a welcome messenger of peace and rest. The funeral took place on Tuesday and was largely attended by sympathizing friends. Rev. F. W. Straw officiated, and told of the Christian confidence and hope of the departed.

It was a painful surprise to this community on Tuesday morning to learn the Mr. Samuel Jacka had died the evening previous at his farm home in the town of Mineral Point, in the neighborhood known as Graysville. It has been the privilege of the writer to know Mr. Jacka from early manhood, and through all these many years to note his strict integrity, and other manly virtues. Through untiring industry and judicious economy he had won success and independence as a farmer, under circumstances which only a few so well meet and overcome. His widow and children who must deeply mourn for the devoted husband and father, have the consolation of knowing that their sorrow is appreciated by hundreds who knowing him can estimate the greatness of their loss.
   Although he had not been well for some time, there was no apprehension that death was near until a few hours before it came. Monday morning Mr. Jacka intended coming to the city to consult a physician, but feeling scarcely able for the short journey concluded instead to send for a physician to call on him. Dr. McDonald was therefore summoned, who immediately saw that the afflicted man had but a few hours more to live, and advised him to adjust his business affairs at once. Attorney A. S. White was called in, some legal papers drawn for Mr. Jacka's signature, and by 4 o'clock of the same day his spirit had fled. He was about 57 years of age, and had resided in the vicinity where death found him from boyhood.

After waiting a sufficient length of time, as was supposed, and there being no explosion, Mr. Manly, thinking the fuse had gone out, repaired to the spot, which he reached at the moment the blast exploded.  He was instantly killed - several pieces of rock striking his head and other parts of his person. Mr. Manly was an industrious laboring man, and leaves a wife and five children, whose support had been mainly dependent upon his labor, to mourn his sudden death. The sympathies of our citizens are with the afflicted family.  Mineral Point Tribune Aug 7, 1867",1867,,,"MPLA Obituary database

In a few minutes, when his wife had retired to the bed, but before she had got fully asleep, she noticed that her husband was breathing heavily and unnaturally. She called him but received no answer.  Then reaching out she got hold of him and shook him, but failed to arouse him. In alarm, she then got up, struck a light and called their two boys from an adjoining room, just in time to see the father draw his expiring breath. It was an unmistakable case of heart failure. He was known to have heart trouble and on two or three occasions had been prostrated by it, but there was not thought that it was imminently dangerous.
  Deceased was 65 years of age. He emigrated from England to Mineral Point in 1847, since which time this has been his home constantly,except for a short time spent in the mines on Lake Superior. He was twice married, the last time to Miss Emma Clark, who survives him. He leaves two sons - one by each marriage, the youngest about 18 years old.

     Mrs. Philippa James, relict of the late John James, died at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Joseph Gribble, in the town of Waldwick, last Saturday evening, aged 84 years and one month.  
     Mrs. James was one of the pioneers of this section, having come to Mineral Point in 1843, with her husband. In 1850 they settled upon the farm in the town of Waldwick, when most of that town was natural prairie and grove. For a few years preceding her husband's death they resided in Mineral Point, but most of her 52 years of life in Wisconsin were spent in the town which she had helped to make a pleasant and prosperous farming community.
     Two sons and a daughter survive, namely, Henry James a prosperous farmer of Waldwick, Uriah James, business at Hollandale, and Mrs. Joseph Gribble, with whom the mother died, besides a number of grandchildren and great grandchildren. Deceased was in perfect health down to a few moments before death. On Christmas she attended a family party at the home of her granddaughter, Mrs. Wm. Uren, returning to the home of her daughter on Friday. A few moments before death on Saturday evening, she complained of being tired on her feet, and retired to her room to lay down. Mrs. Gribble and a neighbor gave the old lady close attention, but she insisted she was not sick, and in no pain. Yet with but a few gasps, on being given a drink, the breath of life departed.
     She was buried in the city cemetery, Mineral Point, beside the remains of her husband, on Monday, a large procession of her neighbors following the familiar and loved form to its final rest.

James James, retired farmer, is a native of Cornwall, England. He was born Feb 10, 1815. He emigrated to the U. S. He arrived in New York April 2, 1840. He came directly to Wisconsin on April 10, 1840. He engaged in mining at Wiota. The first winter he lived in a cabin near Shullsburg. He could see the stars through the roof. He continued mining until 1848, then went farming in the town of Waldwick. In 1852 he started to California and returned in September 1855. He engaged in farming until four years ago when he moved to the city. In 1836 Mr. James married Lavinia Rowe, who was a native of Cornwall, England. She died November 29, 1851. Mr. James then married Mrs. Mary Rees (Reese?) Aug. 23, 2856, leaving one son, William J., living in LaFayette County. She had married James Reese and the son belonged to them. Mr. James has had eleven children, four of whom survive—Susannah, married and living in Nebraska ; Richard, living on the home farm; James D., engaged in business in this city; Joseph H., engaged in business in Sac City, Iowa. 
When Mr. James arrived in Galena he only had 2 cents in his pocket; his success in life is owing to his own efforts; he owns two good farms, besides other property.

Mrs. Jana (sic) Eden - Born in Redruth, Cornwall County, England, August 11, 1813; died at Mineral Point Wis., Nov. 1st, 1882.
   Mrs. Eden from her earliest recollection was susceptible to religious impressions. This susceptibility directed her reading and thought in a time which rendered more vivid those impressions, so that at the age of seventeen she made a public profession of religion by joining the Weslyan Church. On October 8th, 1835, she was married in Redruth to Mr. Philip Eden.
   In October, 1840, she left the home of her youth to join her husband at Galena, Illinois. In 1843 she with her husband and two children settled at Mineral Point, where with the exception of a year or two, she resided to the day of her death. She here joined the M.E. Church. She was a type of that class of Christians whose virtues are best seen and known in the home circle. Her active field of labor was home. She sought to educate those entrusted to her charge in all those departments which fit for intelligent Christian citizenship. She was generous almost to a fault. No one could be more conscientious. A spirit of self-sacrifice was a prominent characteristic of her life. She endeavored throughout to be a consistent Christian. Though not so strong in faith as many, or so rich in religious experience ever distrusting her own power, she ever rested in Christ as her Savior, and when she ___ and knew that earthly life was slipping away from her grasp, she called her family and friends around her, bid them good-bye and asked them to meet her in heaven. Glory, heaven and angels were the words she uttered as she entered that struggle with death which in a few hours terminated her earthly career. She rests in peace.

	During a painful illness of several months duration, she exhibited a remarkable example of patience and resignation in the will of God. Often did she express to her friends a readiness to depart, having a firm hope that for her it would be better than to remain in the body. Knowing in whom she put her trust, she was not afraid of the King of terrors.
	Mrs. Ansley was born, and passed her early life, in the Province of New Brunswick, where she was baptized in the Church of England, and received the Apostolic rite of confirmation according to the ____ of that Church. Removing at an early day to this western country, she was happily united in marriage to a most affectionate and devoted husband, who is now called to mourn her loss.
	There being no services of the Church to which she was baptized and confirmed, she subsequently united with the First Presbyterian Church, in this place. But when she again had the opportunity of listening to the ________ and impressive ritual of her earlier days, her desire was rekindled for the worship and communion of that Church in which she had been educated.
	Accordingly, some six weeks before her death, upon mature deliberation, with the advice of her friends, she sent for the Rector of Trinity Church and acquainted him with her natural desire. That desire having been founded in a deep conviction of conscience and of duty, and not upon any unworthy motive, was gratified; and soon after she received the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ in deep humility and devotion to her great and endless comfort. Constantly, and especially when her sickness was evidently drawing nigh until death, she spoke of the full assurance she had of her reconciliation to God, and of the joys which awaited her in the future life. Expressing at the same time thankfulness to God that He had put it into her heart to choose His service as the better path from her youth up.
	Realizing the real importance and the ____ rewards of a Religious life, she desired that subject of her own funeral discourse might be taken from that ______ ___ of our Lord, “Mary hath chosen that great part which shall not be taken from her;” and also that Dr. Muhlenburg’s beautiful hymn “I would not live alway,” might be sung.
	Thus with a clear, calm and cheerful mind did she, almost in the presence of death, make arrangement for her body to be committed to the dust, and to ____ her soul into the hands of her Creator and Redeemer.
	She was a woman of a firm mind, of warm attachments - a most affectionate wife and mother. That which ____ her uneasiness of mind in time of her approaching dissolution, was to part with her weeping husband and children: but strengthened by the good Lord of all power and might, she was enabled to drink from this fuller cup. Long will they have cause to lament their untimely loss.
	During her sickness her sufferings were mitigated by the kind attentions of affection friends, who never intermitted their duties, nor forsook her couch, and whose tender solicitudes which she gratefully acknowledged soothed her last agonies.
	Her funeral took place on Wednesday at 2 o’clock P.M. from Trinity Church. An unusual degree of solemnity and attention was observable throughout; a _____ concourse of friends and acquaintances by their presence and sympathy, manifesting that they entertained a sincere regard for the deceased, and were deeply affected by her removal, and the affliction of her family. - Com.

Gravesite of Louis Henry Poquette (1816-1880),64,,,26,12,1816,,,Ontario,Ontario,,CA,Canada, Ontario Canada,51.253775,-85.323214,"Louis Poquette was born in 1816 in the province of 'Upper Canada' now called Ontario province. At the age of 16, he signed on with John Jacob Astor's American Fur Co. as a 'voyageur' [a rookie canoe-man/porter of furs]. He worked for the Green Bay unit for the years 1833 and 1834. 

In 1834, the Green Bay unit of the company to which he belonged declared bankruptcy and Louis parted ways with the fur trade. In 1870, Louis gave testimony in an Iowa County court that he first became acquainted with a certain tract of land in Mineral Point, WI, in 1834. He may have still been working as a voyageur when he traveled into Mineral Point, but he certainly became aware of the ease with which the miners were locating the mineral ore, lead, simply by picking it up off the surface of the land, and by digging [at that time] shallow mines.

Between 1837 and 1841, Louis Poquette focused his digging at a mine designated the 'Duke Smith diggings. 'At that time [1841], he was arrested for 'claim-jumping,' although through the eventual testimony presented at the long series of trials, it was proven that he had permission from the [then] owner of the land to mine there.

Louis Poquette married Jane Selena Holmes in 1844, daughter of Thomas and Sarah [Cotton] Holmes, British immigrants and the first naturalized citizens of Iowa County, WI [page 1, Naturalizations]. Jane was only the age of 14, and her father signed permission for her to marry. In 1846, Louis mortgaged a house in Dodgeville for his growing family. This mortgage was not recorded in county records until 1850.

Louis received a land patent in 1849 for a farm in the bounds of Linden township, and continued to add to his land over the next five years. He mined for lead during the winter season, and appeared to be doing moderately well.

There may have been some chronic illness in the family, such as tuberculosis. 5 male babies died in infancy, and one daughter, Mary C, aged about 26 years, died of diphtheria, as had one of her infant brothers, during the same epidemic. In 1859, Jane's father, Thomas Holmes died, and following this event, her mother was taken into custody by the sheriff as an insane person, and released into Louis Poquette's custody for a brief period, until she was committed to the care of the county, where she died in 1860.

In the 1870's, the claim-jumping trial had grown to include other defendants, and had transformed into a case before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Louis and his son, John were merely 'pawns' in the case, and my records include their personal testimony from the transcripts. They appear to have been innocent of wrong-doing,as many prominent citizens stood up on their behalf, although they themselves appeared to be of lower income and education.

Jane Selena 'Jennie' was in such good community standing, that the minister of the Trinity Episcopal Church, March Chase, and his wife, stood up as godparents for a few of her grandchildren. She also testified in the pension application of her son-in-law, Thomas Ward Mitchell, that she was a midwife, and had been present at the births of her daughter's [Louisa's] children.

In 1879, the 26-year old daughter, Mary C, died of the diphtheria epidemic, and Louis himself died in Nov. of 1880.

This esteemed and wellknown citizen died at his home in this city Sunday night, aged 76 years. Deceased was a native of England, and became a resident of Mineral Point over forty years ago. For some time he was engaged in farming a few miles east of the city, but for several years has resided within the city, having reached the time of life when age and strength were insufficient for vigorous pursuits. He has been through life a faithful member and active worker in the M.E. church, acting as a class leader for more than a quarter of a century. He was three times married. By his first wife several children were born to him, and then she was taken from him, leaving them in his care when quite young. Of these five are now living, to wit: William, John, Susan, Caroline and Joseph.
