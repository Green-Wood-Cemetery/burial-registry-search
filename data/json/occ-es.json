[not sure if  this is correct - check History of Iowa CO - nsp]\nJohn D. Ansley was the son of Thomas and Mary (Scott) Ansley. He was born in Canada.\nAnsley is said to have been married but left no family. He is mentioned in his father's letters as of a roving disposition and as spending part of his life at sea. In 1829 [check this - very early nsp] he went to Mineral Point, Wisconsin and became a prominent man in the territory of Wisconsin, being known as Col. Ansley. The last record of his activities is of a trip to England to finance his mining operations. Source: \"Our Ansley Family\" by Harold Ansley Davidson, 1933, p. 16.\n\nFrom WI Dictionary of History re: John D. Ansley\nIn 1829 he was a resident of Mineral Point where he owned a dry-goods store and a copper mine three miles to the south. In 1835 and 1836 he was smelting ore that assayed as much as 20 to 30 per cent copper and was bringing high prices in Boston. Encouraged by his prospects, he obtained capital investors in Pennsylvania. Adverse reports by George W. Featherstonhaugh, however, resulted in his backers having him jailed for fraud. He next sought capital in England but again Featherstonhaugh's reports prevented consummation of his plans. His mine was incorporated in the Iowa Copper Company in 1844. J. Schafer, Wis.

Editors, is the brief announcement of an event by which one of the oldest and most respected citizens of this place has passed from among us.\n    Curtis Beech was born in Pitcher, Chenango county, N.Y. March 21st, 1805. He resided mostly in his native town till at the age of 30 he came to make his home in the Territory of Wisconsin, where he lived till his death.\n     In the earlier history of this place he was a leading business man, and, as the writer has heard him say, knew by name almost every resident for 20 miles around. as a man and a neighbor he was universally esteemed. With strict integrity and a kind heart, he combined to a rare degree, a mirthfulness and humor which made him to the very last, an agreeable companion, even to the youth.\n    But is was as a Christian that he left the deepest impression here. hopefully converted at the age of 22, he became from the first an active christian, laboring with great zeal and fidelity in the prayer-meeting and sunday school; and these labors distinguished him to the end of his life. He organized the first sunday school that was held in Mineral Point and that before a church edifice was built here. the date of that beginning was, it is believed, 1837. From that time to his final prostration by his last sickness, he held the position of Superintendent of the sunday school, and discharged its duties with a promptness and fidelity rarely equaled in any place. Though the school was divided and part went to form the nucleus of what is now the large and prosperous school of the M.E. Church, yet may we safely say that the original school remained under his care so long as he lived; thus presenting, as we think, not only the oldest sunday school now in the State, but the rare spectacle of a sunday school presided over by the same man for 29 years.\n     At the organization of the Presbyterian Church, June 30, 1839, the name of Curtis Beech stands first on the list of proposed members; and after its organization he was the first man elected as Ruling Elder, though but a young man of 34 years. Hence, as a Church, we lose in him our first member, our first Ruling Elder, and the first and only Superintendent of our Sunday school.\n    In all his duties as a christian he showed the same faithfulness and regularity that so endeared him to the children. Rarely absent from any service, whether on the Sabbath or devotional gatherings on other days, he has left an example most worthy of imitation. Truly \"the memory of the just be blessed.\"\n     \"Rest from thy labors, rest,\n      Soul of the just set free;\n      Blest be thy mem'ry, and blessed\n      Thy bright example be.\"\nMineral Point Tribune  July 11, 1866","obit_year":"1866","notes":"","grave_location":"","sources":"Find A Grave\n1966-68\nMPLA Obituary database\n1966-68 Church Women's List","cemetery":"Old City Cemetery, Mineral Point, WI"}

Henry, lawyer and banker, Mineral Point; was born in St. Louis, Mo., May 9, 1823; he came to Galena, Ill., with his parents, in 1824, arriving there in May of that year; remained in Galena until the spring of 1833, when, with his parents, he took up his abode with Capt. De Seelhorst, of Elk Grove, now in La Fayette County; in October of 1833, he removed to Dodgeville, where his father engaged in merchandising and was also appointed the first Postmaster; in October, 1834, his father located in Mineral Point, where William T. has since resided, with the exception of a brief period spent in the gold mines of California. He attended the common schools of his locality until 1837 and 1838, when he went to Springfield and took a two-years course in the high school of that city; returning home in 1839, he entered the store of Curtis Beech, one of the pioneer merchants of the city, serving in the capacity of clerk; was subsequently appointed Deputy Clerk of the United States Court, and served under Dr. Edward McSherry, George W. Jones and Henry L. Dodge, and, in May, 1846, Mr. Henry was appointed by Judge Dunn Clerk of the United States Court, which office he held until Jan, 1, 1849; in the interregnum between his appointments to office, Mr. Henry was engaged in mining. He was married, Aug. 2, 1848, to Miss Nellie, daughter of Gen. William R. and Mary Smith at Mineral Point; had one child—William Francis, who died June 15,1850, aged 1 year. Oct 8,1849, Mr. Henry started for California, via Panama, and returned to Mineral Point, via Nicaragua, Oct. 12,1851; he again left for California Nov. 11, 1851, accompanied by his wife, who was then suffering with consumption. Mrs. Henry did not live to return, having died in Sacramento City Dec. 17, 1852. William T. returned to Mineral Point May 6, 1855, and was appointed Secretary of the Mineral Point Railroad Company, and continued in this capacity until the road was successfully completed to this point. While acting as Secretary of the Mineral Point Railroad Company, he commenced an abstract of the county and established his law business, and, in the fall of 1861 adding thereto the banking business, all of which he still continues; aside from this, Mr. Henry is extensively engaged in mining, and, with his partner, John J. Ross, owns perhaps the most valuable mineral range in Southwestern Wisconsin. He married Mrs. Emma Parmele, daughter of Rev. Stephen McHugh, Sept. 18,1856; she had two sons by her former marriage— Thomas and Charles Parmele. now in Mr. Henry's bank. By this union Mr. Henry had five children, all of whom are living—Nettie E., William T., Cora M., Emma N., Francis G. Emma N. is attending school at Kenosha and William T., Jr., at Racine. Mr. Henry has always been a Democrat; has been frequently elected Mayor of the city, although he is not a politician nor office-seeker, and has always possessed, in a marked degree, the confidence of the business men in the community, no matter which political party they belonged to. He is remarkably energetic and industrious, liberal and charitable, and, amidst his great and varied business cares, he has found time to become a learned and accomplished mineralogist. His cabinet of minerals is one of the largest and best selected in the United States, and no man in the State is so thoroughly acquainted with the geology of the lead region.","gravestone_transcription":"William Turner Henry\nBorn May 9, 1823  Died July 2, 1883","death_cause":"","comments":"Replacement stone","death_date":"1883-07-2","death_day":"02","death_city":"Mineral Point","death_county":"Iowa","death_state":"WI","death_state_full":"Wisconsin","death_location":"Mineral Point Wisconsin United States","death_lat":"42.859997","death_lon":"-90.17984729999999","death_month":"07","death_certificate":"","death_year":"1883","death_circa":"","forename":"William","surname":"Henry","maiden_name":"","middle_name":"Turner","obit_day":"05","obit_month":"07","obit_source":"MP Tribune","obit_transcription":"","obit_year":"1883","notes":"replacement stone; Wm T Sr","grave_location":"NW.19.1","sources":"Find A Grave\n1966-68\n1984\nCurrent\nMPLA Obituary database\n1966-68 Church Women's List\n1984 Eagle Scout Map","cemetery":"Old City Cemetery, Mineral Point, WI"}

April 21, 1833, she became the wife of William Lanyon, and continued such until her death, the couple celebrating the 65th anniversary of their wedding last April. In 1840 she came with her husband to Wisconsin, and resided her continuously thereafter.  Fourteen sons and one daughter were born to the sturdy couple. The daughter died when four years old, at Linden, where the family temporarily resided on coming to the territory. The two first born sons died in England. One died of gas suffocation when five years old, while playing about his father's furnace in this city. One other son died in early childhood, and the youngest, when a lad of about eight years, was accidentally drowned by falling into a cistern, several years ago. Nine stalwart sons survive to cherish the memory of a devoted mother and to comfort their honored father. They are: William, Cyrus, Josiah John, Simon, Albert, Samuel, Robert, and Edwin. Mrs. Lanyon was a worthy type of pioneer wife. With her own hands she did the household work incident to caring for her large family through their childhood. n those days before sewing machines or steam laundries, her expert needle and industrious hands kept her many boys comfortably clothed, clean and well fed. Even in later years her needlework had been a wonder and admiration to the younger generation.

For half a century the name of William Lanyon has been familiar to the readers of the Tribune. Few names have appeared in these columns oftener, and now with deep regret we reprint the name to record that he who bore it is but a memory. Saturday morning Feb. 11th, the spirit of William Lanyon took its flight for the undiscovered country, and Tuesday morning his mortal remains were laid beside those of his life companion, in the old Mineral Point cemetery.\n\tMr. Lanyon was born Nov. 8, 1810, and consequently had lived almost 89 years. His birthplace was Elston, England. There he grew to manhood, one of a family of nine sturdy brothers and sisters. He learned the trade of blacksmith and machinist, and prosecuted the business throughout the years of his active life. In 1833 he married the wife whose death was recorded only last August. In 1840 they came to America, and located in Wisconsin, which was ever after their home.\n\tSoon after arriving here Mr. Lanyon was recognized as a forceful factor in the development of the town. Never content with what was, when he thought it could be enlarged or bettered. He took hold of any proper enterprise readily furnishing employment for men when they otherwise might have been idle, and making improvements that might not have been but for him. Such a man could but stimulate enterprise in others, accomplish much for the general good, and leave an impress upon the community in which he operated. No history of the progress of Mineral Point can be completed without the name of William Lanyon frequently therein. In business he was honorable as he was energetic, in social intercourse kind and considerate, to his adopted country thoroughly loyal and to his family strongly devoted.\n\tUntil the death of his wife he was a wonder of physical activity for so old a man. Since she was taken from him he has failed rapidly, but bore up manfully till the last, when he quietly surrendered, full of christian hope that there awaited him the rewards of a well spent, useful life.\n\tThe funeral Tuesday morning with services by Rev Thos. Kent, was attended by his brothers Robert and Samuel, his sons Cyrus, Josiah, John, Simon, Albert, and Edwin, besides a large number of other relatives, long time neighbors and friends, many of whom came great distances to pay last respects to the honored dead. Three sons were unable to attend, viz: William, Samuel and Robert. \nMineral Point Tribune Feb 16, 1899","obit_year":"1899","notes":"tombstone date of birth: 11/2","grave_location":"NE.05.1","sources":"Find A Grave\n1978\n1984\nCurrent\n1976\n1976 Women's Club Map\n1984 Eagle Scout Map\nMPLA Obituary database","cemetery":"Old City Cemetery, Mineral Point, WI"},

The boy had carried dinner to Mr. Sherman, engineer at the mill, who is a boarder of Mrs. Luke. After eating his dinner, Mr. Sherman told the boy he had better return home, not wanting him to remain about the mill, and he went out of the building through the engine room door. But he must have reentered by some other way, as he was seen in and about other parts of the building during the afternoon. Discovery of the accident, about 5 o’clock, came through the slipping of a belt and the interruption of operating machinery, which led one of the employes (sic) on the third floor to open the door of the elevator shaft. There the boy was found, held between the elevator platform and the top of the door casing in the shaft. He was taken out at once. His pulses were felt to throb a few times and then ceased forever. Death must have been almost instantaneous, as the interruption of operating machinery occasioned by the clogging of the elevator was but a moment before the shaft door was opened.\n\tThe theory of the mill men is that the boy must have got into the elevator on one of the lower floors and pulled the rope that operated it. That finding himself being carried to the top of the shaft he attempted to open the door at the third floor and failing was caught between the moving elevator platform and the door sill, as described. Some of his ribs were broken and the body flattened considerably but there was no mutilation.\n\tThe accident is a terrible blow to the widowed mother with whom every parent heart beats in pained sympathy.\n\tThe family gratefully acknowledge the kindness of many friends in this great sorrow.

He was born at Camborne, Cornwall England, July 22, 1816, and was at the time of his death nearly 81 years of age. His early life was shadowed by the death of his mother, and he was the ninth in his family of ten children and was the only one left to cross the river. His early life was the usual one of toil to those born in his station, and at the age of nine years he became a toiler in the mine. Having, when of suitable age, married Miss Mary Nichols, he, with other members of the family, came to Wisconsin in 1842 and in Iowa county he made his home ever after, except for the few years he spent in digging gold in California. In 1848 he buried his wife and in due time was married to Miss Joanna Baker, of Linden, who lived until 1871. In 1873 he was married to Mrs. Kislingbury, who after a union of twenty-four years survives him. He was an industrious and upright man, an intelligent citizen and an ardent republican. But his chief delight was in his church and Bible. . . .  The funeral last Sunday afternoon was very largely attended, the entire Sunday school forming a long procession and escorting the remains from the home to the church.

Deceased was born in Staffordville [Staffordshire], England, April 27, 1830, and at the same year \ncame with her parents to America, settling in Pennsylvania; five years later she moved with her parents to Wisconsin.”\n\n“In 1844 she was married to LOUIS POQUETTE; thirteen children were born to them. Four sons and two daughters survive the mother, all of whom were present at the funeral, namely; John H, Beloit; Louis and Leonard of Waldwick; George of this city; Mrs. Josephine Davis, of Willow Springs; Mrs. Sophia Powell of Shullsburg. In 1898 she was united in marriage to Mr. Jonathan Matthews, who is \nleft to mourn the loss of a devoted Christian wife.”\n“The funeral took place on Tuesday morning, with services at Trinity Episcopal Church, Rev. Mr. Chase officiating; and burial in Graceland Cemetery*. The large attendance of neighbors and friends attested to the high esteem in which \nthe deceased was held by the community.”\nAdditional Comments:\n[*Iowa County record of death states that she was buried in City Cemetery, Mineral Point, WI, as do Rev. Chase’s church notes. There we find a headstone for LOUIS POQUETTE and his children, but JANE’s name is not carved on the stone. The Matthews family had a family plot on the ‘Wallace farm.’ Could JANE have been buried there, since the newspaper and the Death Record do not agree?]\n\nFile at: http://files.usgwarchives.net/wi/iowa/obits/h/holmespo277gob.txt","obit_year":"1902","notes":"b.d. per obit: 4/27/1830; married name per obit: Matthews\nunclear as to where she is buried; Graceland? as per obit; OCC as per death record and Rev Chase's church records","grave_location":"","sources":"Find A Grave\nPossible Candidate","cemetery":"Old City Cemetery, Mineral Point, WI"}

Hearing much said about the chances for working men in America, he, in company with his late wife, left the old home and arrived at Mineral Point in 1847. Excepting brief stays in Dodgeville and parts of California, this city has ever since been his home. For many years he lived without God and hope, but during the winter of '70 and '71 he was led to see the follies of sin and became a lover and follower after righteousness. His religious character has been of the emotional type. He cultivated high degrees of feeling and always enjoyed best the means of grace that were characterized by this same feature. He has been a faithful member of the P.M. society, being a pattern to others in his attendance on the services of God's house - both social and public. His prayer in the P.M. vestry on last Monday week was so full of unction that it elicited favorable comment. For the last five or six years he has been a failing man, having in that time passed through seasons of severe afflictions. He has for a long time been simply waiting to be relieved from the infirmities of the flesh. Relief came on Friday afternoon. While in the act of carrying an armful of wood into his home he strained himself, producing the cough which burst the vein that gave escape to life's fluid. He died on the porch of his house.\nMineral Point Tribune, Oct. 7, 1886","obit_year":"1886","notes":"","grave_location":"NW.21.2","sources":"Find A Grave\n1966-68\n1984\nCurrent\n1966-68 Church Women's List\n1984 Eagle Scout Map","cemetery":"Old City Cemetery, Mineral Point, WI"},

The circumstances appear to be about as follows: Between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, Mrs. Terrill left her home to visit the lately bereaved Mrs. Strachan. About 10 P.M. she started on her return home in usual health. A few minutes later, some men passing on the sidewalk near Trinity Church found her a corpse. For years Mrs. Terrill had been afflicted with heart disease, and was subject to sudden prostrating spasms; it is supposed that walking against the strong cold wind, produced one of these attacks, resulting in almost instant death.\n   Mrs Terrill was one of the oldest residents of Mineral Point, and few enjoyed so large an acquaintance and so general esteem. Wherever was sickness or bereavement, she was oftener found, perhaps, than any other lady of our city, giving help and consolation. Many whose pillows of pain have been smoothed by her ministering hands, and many whose desolate hearts have been cheered by her presence, will cherish her memory and now join in deepest sympathy with her bereaved family in mourning her sad passage to the other shore. She was 57 years of age. The funeral on Tuesday was one of the largest ever known in the city.

Dr. Van Dusen came to Mineral Point is 1848, from Tully, New York, and for over 35 years attended to the duties of his profession in this city and vicinity.

The Doctor did not die RICH - not because he had not had practice enough, nor because he was a spendthrift, but because the average moral sense of so many people does not reach to the doctor's bill; it, like the printer's, can go over. He was one of the organizers of the State Medical Association, and was greatly honored by the leading men of his profession throughout the state.

His taking off was caused by inflammation of the lungs, from which he had suffered several days in a hopeless condition. He was one of the first and most constant settlers in Iowa county, coming here in 1832, and, with the exception of but a few months, has been here ever since. His good qualities were many and hid in oblivion what trifling errors he might have possessed. Considerate, kind-hearted and generous from youth to age - qualities that insured him respect all through life, and will glisten in the halls of memory long after his death.\n   Following is a sketch of his career in life from the time he left his place of nativity up to his demise, as taken mainly from the recently compiled history of Iowa county:\n   Francis Vivian, the veteran ex-county treasurer of Iowa county, was born Feb. 19, 1801, in Camborn, Cornwall, England: his early life was spent in the tin and copper mines of Cornwall.  The year 1832 found him in Mineral Point, and the day after his arrival here he enlisted in Capt. John Moore's company to war against Black Hawk, and remained at the garrison in this place until the red chief was overthrown. Mr. V. then mined lead a year on the Van Matre survey; spent a few months in Dubuque, and then locating in Mineral Point, resided here for twenty-five years. For a few years he kept store; was then for a few years a partner of Jenkings & Musgrove, in the smelting business; he was next employed by a Buffalo, N.Y., firm as agent in buying mineral. He was one of the first men to be elected President of the village of Mineral Point. In '56 he was elected county treasurer, which position he held for sixteen years, probably a greater length of time than any man in the northwest in the same office. In 1865 he settled in Dodgeville, and from there removed to his farm in '74; 80 acres of this farm he secured from the government in early day. He married in 1827, Dinah Kendall, of Cornwall; she died in '59, leaving three children - Mrs. Jas. Toay and Mrs. Cyrus Lanyon, of this city, and William F., a farmer. In '60 he married again, to Miss Jane Hollow; they had five children, all but one survive him. \"Uncle Frank\", as he was best known, was a good type of the men who hewed down the barriers, that settlement and civilization might follow them into the State and county.\n     The remains on being brought to this city on Sunday for interment by the side of his first wife, were rested in the P.M. church, toward which he liberally contributed in its infancy, and a short, appropriate funeral service held, Rev.

Deceased was a woman of great kindness of heart, a true wife, whose constant aim appeared to be to bring sunshine and happiness to the lives of others. Her aged husband survives her, also her niece, Mss Erskine, who has been with her constantly during her illness. Though for many years she remained closely at home, this fact did not lessen the number of her friends who know and appreciated her true worth, and loved her for her gentle, self sacrificing spirit.

It was a painful surprise to this community on Tuesday morning to learn the Mr. Samuel Jacka had died the evening previous at his farm home in the town of Mineral Point, in the neighborhood known as Graysville. It has been the privilege of the writer to know Mr. Jacka from early manhood, and through all these many years to note his strict integrity, and other manly virtues. Through untiring industry and judicious economy he had won success and independence as a farmer, under circumstances which only a few so well meet and overcome. His widow and children who must deeply mourn for the devoted husband and father, have the consolation of knowing that their sorrow is appreciated by hundreds who knowing him can estimate the greatness of their loss.\n   Although he had not been well for some time, there was no apprehension that death was near until a few hours before it came. Monday morning Mr. Jacka intended coming to the city to consult a physician, but feeling scarcely able for the short journey concluded instead to send for a physician to call on him. Dr. McDonald was therefore summoned, who immediately saw that the afflicted man had but a few hours more to live, and advised him to adjust his business affairs at once. Attorney A. S. White was called in, some legal papers drawn for Mr. Jacka's signature, and by 4 o'clock of the same day his spirit had fled. He was about 57 years of age, and had resided in the vicinity where death found him from boyhood. The funeral yesterday, the 10th, was largely attended, services being held in the P.M. church; and burial in the city cemetery.

William Cornelius died very suddenly at his home in this city last Thursday night. He had been apparently as well as usual during the day, pursuing his usual vocations, and through the evening, which he spent at home with his family, he seemed to be in perfect health. between 9 and 10 o'clock when the family retired, Mr. Cornelius said to his wife that he would lie upon the floor beside the bed for a while, as he often did in warm weather, and taking some bedding laid down. In a few minutes, when his wife had retired to the bed, but before she had got fully asleep, she noticed that her husband was breathing heavily and unnaturally. She called him but received no answer.  Then reaching out she got hold of him and shook him, but failed to arouse him. In alarm, she then got up, struck a light and called their two boys from an adjoining room, just in time to see the father draw his expiring breath. It was an unmistakable case of heart failure. He was known to have heart trouble and on two or three occasions had been prostrated by it, but there was not thought that it was imminently dangerous.\n  Deceased was 65 years of age. He emigrated from England to Mineral Point in 1847, since which time this has been his home constantly,except for a short time spent in the mines on Lake Superior. He was twice married, the last time to Miss Emma Clark, who survives him. He leaves two sons - one by each marriage, the youngest about 18 years old. The remains were deposited in the city cemetery Sunday afternoon.

Often did she express to her friends a readiness to depart, having a firm hope that for her it would be better than to remain in the body. Knowing in whom she put her trust, she was not afraid of the King of terrors.\n\tMrs. Ansley was born, and passed her early life, in the Province of New Brunswick, where she was baptized in the Church of England, and received the Apostolic rite of confirmation according to the ____ of that Church. Removing at an early day to this western country, she was happily united in marriage to a most affectionate and devoted husband, who is now called to mourn her loss.\n\tThere being no services of the Church to which she was baptized and confirmed, she subsequently united with the First Presbyterian Church, in this place. But when she again had the opportunity of listening to the ________ and impressive ritual of her earlier days, her desire was rekindled for the worship and communion of that Church in which she had been educated.\n\tAccordingly, some six weeks before her death, upon mature deliberation, with the advice of her friends, she sent for the Rector of Trinity Church and acquainted him with her natural desire. That desire having been founded in a deep conviction of conscience and of duty, and not upon any unworthy motive, was gratified; and soon after she received the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ in deep humility and devotion to her great and endless comfort. Constantly, and especially when her sickness was evidently drawing nigh until death, she spoke of the full assurance she had of her reconciliation to God, and of the joys which awaited her in the future life.

That which ____ her uneasiness of mind in time of her approaching dissolution, was to part with her weeping husband and children: but strengthened by the good Lord of all power and might, she was enabled to drink from this fuller cup. Long will they have cause to lament their untimely loss.\n\tDuring her sickness her sufferings were mitigated by the kind attentions of affection friends, who never intermitted their duties, nor forsook her couch, and whose tender solicitudes which she gratefully acknowledged soothed her last agonies.\n\tHer funeral took place on Wednesday at 2 o’clock P.M. from Trinity Church. An unusual degree of solemnity and attention was observable throughout; a _____ concourse of friends and acquaintances by their presence and sympathy, manifesting that they entertained a sincere regard for the deceased, and were deeply affected by her removal, and the affliction of her family. - Com.

At the age of 16, he signed on with John Jacob Astor's American Fur Co. as a 'voyageur' [a rookie canoe-man/porter of furs]. He worked for the Green Bay unit for the years 1833 and 1834. \n\nIn 1834, the Green Bay unit of the company to which he belonged declared bankruptcy and Louis parted ways with the fur trade. In 1870, Louis gave testimony in an Iowa County court that he first became acquainted with a certain tract of land in Mineral Point, WI, in 1834. He may have still been working as a voyageur when he traveled into Mineral Point, but he certainly became aware of the ease with which the miners were locating the mineral ore, lead, simply by picking it up off the surface of the land, and by digging [at that time] shallow mines.\n\nBetween 1837 and 1841, Louis Poquette focused his digging at a mine designated the 'Duke Smith diggings. 'At that time [1841], he was arrested for 'claim-jumping,' although through the eventual testimony presented at the long series of trials, it was proven that he had permission from the [then] owner of the land to mine there.\n\nLouis Poquette married Jane Selena Holmes in 1844, daughter of Thomas and Sarah [Cotton] Holmes, British immigrants and the first naturalized citizens of Iowa County, WI [page 1, Naturalizations]. Jane was only the age of 14, and her father signed permission for her to marry. In 1846, Louis mortgaged a house in Dodgeville for his growing family. This mortgage was not recorded in county records until 1850.\n\nLouis received a land patent in 1849 for a farm in the bounds of Linden township, and continued to add to his land over the next five years. He mined for lead during the winter season, and appeared to be doing moderately well.\n\nThere may have been some chronic illness in the family, such as tuberculosis. 5 male babies died in infancy, and one daughter, Mary C, aged about 26 years, died of diphtheria, as had one of her infant brothers, during the same epidemic. In 1859, Jane's father, Thomas Holmes died, and following this event, her mother was taken into custody by the sheriff as an insane person, and released into Louis Poquette's custody for a brief period, until she was committed to the care of the county, where she died in 1860.\n\nIn the 1870's, the claim-jumping trial had grown to include other defendants, and had transformed into a case before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Louis and his son, John were merely 'pawns' in the case, and my records include their personal testimony from the transcripts. They appear to have been innocent of wrong-doing,as many prominent citizens stood up on their behalf, although they themselves appeared to be of lower income and education.\n\nJane Selena 'Jennie' was in such good community standing, that the minister of the Trinity Episcopal Church, March Chase, and his wife, stood up as godparents for a few of her grandchildren.

He has been through life a faithful member and active worker in the M.E. church, acting as a class leader for more than a quarter of a century. He was three times married.

Only one, Joseph, the youngest, was with the father when he died, the others being in as many different parts of the country. The second Mrs. Odgers after giving to the family a mother's care through several years was also taken to her final home, and Mr. Odgers found in the present widow a faithful helpmate and companion down life's closing term.
